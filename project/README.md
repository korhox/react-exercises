# Instructions

The project manager should be intuitive. It consists of projects which has boards and boards have issues.
We agreed with the teacher that it is all right to use Kanban style boards and issues instead of tasks and contexts.

- Some times json-server crashes when doing actions too fast. This is a known bug and it is not a problem with the project itself, but an issue with backend.

Note: tested on Google Chrome & Firefox
